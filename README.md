Project title: Biomarker-Based Early Prediction of Parkinson’s Disease Onset Using Machine Learning

What is PD?
- Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurological condition that progresses over time and often goes undetected
until motor symptoms, such as tremor or rigidity, arise, by which point the brain has suffered severe
damage.

What is a biomarker?
- A biomarker (short for biological marker) is a measurable indicator of some biological state or condition. It’s typically a molecule, gene, characteristic, or substance in the body that can be measured objectively to indicate

Project Aim:
• To collect and analyze patient’s biomarkers, including sleep patterns, voice changes, mood or
mental state changes, minor motor abnormalities, and, where feasible, molecular biomarkers
from blood or other easily accessible biofluids.
• To develop a machine learning system that is able to predict an individual's likelihood of
developing Parkinson's Disease up to seven years before clinical diagnosis, using biomarkers.
• To implement a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for summarizing patient
reports and model outputs into simplified formats.
• To design a model with high accuracy, sensitivity, and interpretability to aid in early
intervention and accurate diagnosis.
